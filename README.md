# Mini Arithmetic Expression Evaluator

## Overview
The **Mini Arithmetic Expression Evaluator** is a Python-based application designed to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamental concepts of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles parentheses for controlling the order of operations.
- Provides error handling for invalid expressions.

## Components
1. **Lexer**: Converts input strings into tokens.
2. **Parser**: Constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens.
3. **Evaluator**: Traverses the AST to compute the final result.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository or download the files:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
